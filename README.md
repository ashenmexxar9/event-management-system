## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 16.x
- npm or yarn

## Installation & Setup

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The `.env` file will contain:
```
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-in-production
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
DATABASE_PATH=./data/events.db
```

4. Seed the database with sample data:
```bash
npm run seed
```

This will create:
- Admin user: `admin@example.com` / `Admin@123`
- Regular user: `user@example.com` / `User@123`
- Sample venues with different availability states
- Sample events linked to venues
- Sample guests, schedule, tasks, vendors, and expenses
- Sample tickets and registrations for ticketing and reporting

5. Start the backend server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will run on `http://localhost:5000`

### Frontend Setup

1. In a new terminal, navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will run on `http://localhost:5173`

## Running the Application

### Development Mode

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

### Production Build

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
npm i
npm run build
npm start
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm i
npm run dev
```

### Database Issues
- Delete `data/events.db` and run `npm run seed` again
- Ensure `data/` directory exists

### CORS Errors
- Ensure backend is running on `http://localhost:5000`
- Update `FRONTEND_URL` in backend if needed

### Login Issues
- Verify database was seeded: `npm run seed`
- Check credentials: admin@example.com / Admin@123
- Clear browser cookies and try again
